Deno rand library
=

[![Build Status][actions-img]][actions-url]<br>(CI tests on Linux, Mac, Windows)

Random utilities for getting random numbers in Deno conveniently.

It uses the standard
[`crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues)
to get cryptographically strong random data.

In Deno `crypto.getRandomValues()` was implemented in
[PR #2327](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2327)
using Rust's [`rand::rngs::ThreadRng`](https://docs.rs/rand/0.6.5/rand/rngs/struct.ThreadRng.html)
(see also Deno's
[Issue #1891: Implement webcrypto APIs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1891)
and
[Issue #2321: Add Crypto.getRandomValues()](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/2321)).

This module should work in the browser and in Node.js
but currently it was only tested in Deno (on Linux, Mac and Windows).

Work in progress.

Usage
-

```ts
import rand from './mod.ts';

// random 7-bit unsigned integer:
const x = rand.u7();

// random 5-bit signed integer:
const y = rand.s6();
```

Short API:

```ts
import { u7 } from './mod.ts';

const x = u7(); // random 7-bit unsigned integer
```

Readable API:

```ts
import { randU7 } from './mod.ts';

const x = randU7(); // random 7-bit unsigned integer
```

The advantage of `randU7()` vs `rand.u7()`
is that you can import only what you need and avoid
mistakenly writing `s7` instead of `u7` etc.

`Math.random()` replacement:

```ts
import { f64 } from './mod.ts';

Math.random = f64;
```

The `f64()` function should be a drop-in replacement
for `Math.random()` with **exactly** the same range and
distribution, but using cryptographically strong random data.
If it is not an exact replacement then it is a bug
and should be filed as an issue.

The `f64()` returns a random 64-bit floating point number
calculated from 64 bits of random data in the same way
as in [ToDouble()](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/085fed0f/src/base/utils/random-number-generator.h#L93-L99)
used by V8 for `Math.random()`.
I.e. it sets 24 of those 64 bits to a fixed exponent,
leaving 40 bits of mantissa random, and subtracts 1 to
get numbers in the range of 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive).
This ensures a uniform distribution of values but it means
that we get only 40 bits of real entropy.

Supported bit widths:

s1,
s2,
s3,
s4,
s5,
s6,
s7,
s8,
s16,
s32,
u1,
u2,
u3,
u4,
u5,
u6,
u7,
u8,
u16,
u32,
f64

TODO:

- Add optional support for `Math.random()`
- Add more bit widths
- Add support for ranges other than round binary numbers
- Add multiple values returned at once
- Optimize with larger prepopulated buffers
- Test in the browser
- Test in Node
- Publish on npm as well

Why it was created
-
I started looking into [ulid](https://github.com/ulid/javascript)
to port it to Deno and I saw in its
[index.ts](https://github.com/ulid/javascript/blob/a5831206a11636c94d4657b9e1a1354c529ee4e9/lib/index.ts)
that it uses a strange way to get a random 5-bit integer:

It gets an 8-bit integer, divides it by 255, then multiplies by 32
and subtracts 1 if the result is 32,
instead of just shifting or masking bits,
and it's not obvious whether the numbers are uniformly distributted
if calculated that way (good thought excercise to prove if they are!).

This shows that simple things like getting a random number
in a particular range can be hard to do
without complicating it in a way that it is hard to see if
the randomness was not accidentally redused in the process.

I believe that code generating cryptographically strong random
numbers should be easy to understand and audit.

This module consists of multiple small functions,
there are many of them but each one is very simple, like:

```ts
const u8buf = new Uint8Array(1);

const u8 = () => crypto.getRandomValues(u8buf)[0];

const u5 = () => u8() >> 3;
```
