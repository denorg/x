The main dependency of this crate is
[rusty_v8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8), which provides the V8-Rust
bindings.

This Rust crate contains the essential V8 bindings for Deno's command-line
interface (Deno CLI). The main abstraction here is the Isolate which provides a
way to execute JavaScript. The Isolate is modeled as a
`Future<Item=(), Error=JSError>` which completes once all of its ops have
completed.

In order to bind Rust functions into JavaScript, use the `Deno.core.dispatch()`
function to trigger the "dispatch" callback in Rust. The user is responsible for
encoding both the request and response into a Uint8Array.

Documentation for this crate is thin at the moment. Please see
[http_bench.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/master/core/examples/http_bench.rs)
as a simple example of usage.

TypeScript support and a lot of other functionality is not available at this
layer. See the [cli](https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/master/cli) for that.
