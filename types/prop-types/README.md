Types for Facebook's Prop-Types library.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/prop-types.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)

You can use prop-types to document the intended types of properties passed to
functions and classes. This library is intended for his use alongside Facebook's
React library, but can be used freely for runtime type checking outside of the
React environment.

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/std/types/prop-types/v15.7.2/prop-types.d.ts"
import PropTypes from "https://cdn.pika.dev/prop-types@15.7.2";
```
