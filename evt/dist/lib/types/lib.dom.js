This is a curated re export of the dom API definitions.

The DOM definitions are available only when "compilerOptions": { "lib": ["DOM"] }}
is present in the tsconfig.json.

We need we re-export those definitions so that we can expose methods that interact with
the DOM ( ex Evt.from ) while not producing type error when
EVT is imported in project that does not use 'lib DOM', typically
projects that targets Node.JS.
